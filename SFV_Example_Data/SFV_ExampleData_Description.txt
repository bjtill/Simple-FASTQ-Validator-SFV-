SFV: Example Data   (Bradley Till, April 5, 2025)

Included in this directory are 8 example FASTQ files, consisting of 4 unique files that are uncompressed and also compressed with bgzip.  One file is correctly formatted, and the program outputs Yes for all checks. The other files contain one error each.  

FILES AND EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

Below shows the command run for each file and the output. All possible commands/outputs are shown only for the first FASTQ file.
